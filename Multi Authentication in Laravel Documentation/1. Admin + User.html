In Laravel 5.4 we actually can natively support multiple User models (Sometimes called MultiAuth). This means we can have different users and manage these users independently, all using the Native Auth Facades, without any packages or plugins. An example of this would be Employees that manage a backend interface and then customers which have the ability to log in and manage accounts, but through the front end of the website. We want to use different tables to manage these types of users, and have different middleware and guards in place as well. This tutorial will show multiple authentication to you.

This isn't documented very well in the Laravel documentation, so it is frustrating to find the correct way to do this. But I am happy that I have now put this tutorial series together to explain how to make this happen. It is a powerful feature that Laravel has and I'm excited to show everyone how to use it.


Step 1: 
- Run: php artisan make:auth
- Run: php artisan make:migration create_admins_table --create=admins

Step 2:
- Duplicate the User.php model and rename it Admin.php
	- Chang only the class name
		class Admin extends Authenticatable
	- Change the $fillable 
		protected $fillable = [
	        'name', 'email', 'password','job_title'
	    ];

Step 3:
- Now we have to setup our guard
- Config out authentication setting we have to go to config/auth.php
- Create a new provider for admins
	'providers' => [
        'users' => [
            'driver' => 'eloquent',
            'model' => App\User::class,
        ],
        'admins' => [
            'driver' => 'eloquent',
            'model' => App\Admin::class,
        ],

        // 'users' => [
        //     'driver' => 'database',
        //     'table' => 'users',
        // ],
    ],


- Create a new guards for admins
	'guards' => [
        'web' => [
            'driver' => 'session',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],

        'api' => [
            'driver' => 'token',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],

        'admin' => [
            'driver' => 'session',
            'provider' => 'admins',
        ],

        'admin-api' => [
            'driver' => 'token',
            'provider' => 'admins',
        ],
    ],

- Change passwords to
	'passwords' => [
        'users' => [
            'provider' => 'users',
            'table' => 'password_resets',
            'expire' => 60,
        ],

        'admins' => [
            'provider' => 'admins',
            'table' => 'password_resets',
            'expire' => 15,
        ],
    ],

- Last things we have to do to Admin model is excepting or knows which gurd work back with. So goto model Admin.php 

	class Admin extends Authenticatable {
    use Notifiable;
    
    protected $guard = 'admin';

Step 4:
- Now crate a controller name AdminController.php to duplicate the HomeController.php
	class AdminController extends Controller
	{
	    
	    public function __construct()
	    {
	        $this->middleware('auth:admin'); // Our middleware we need to define the gurd that we want to protect
	    }

	    
	    public function index()
	    {
	        return view('admin');
	    }
	}


- web.php
	// Auth for Admin
	Route::get('/admin', 'AdminControler@index');

- Duplicate the view/home.blade.php to admin.blade.php

	@extends('layouts.app')

	@section('content')
	    <div class="container">
	        <div class="row">
	            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	                <div class="panel panel-default">
	                    <div class="panel-heading">Admin Dashboard</div>

	                    <div class="panel-body">
	                        @if (session('status'))
	                            <div class="alert alert-success">
	                                {{ session('status') }}
	                            </div>
	                        @endif

	                        You are logged in as <strong>Admin</strong>!
	                    </div>
	                </div>
	            </div>
	        </div>
	    </div>
	@endsection
